# Results

This directory contains three folders, the same exact folders as `../experiments/` (see the corresponding [README](../experiments/README.md)), which correspond to where
the results of the experiments go (e.g. `../experiments/translation_similarity/` experiment results go in `translation_similarity/`).

All `results/` folders in this repo contain sample outputs that will be populated/replaced by running the corresponding experiments. See the main [README](../README.md#steps-to-recreate-the-results) file for more information about the experiments and the results they produce.
